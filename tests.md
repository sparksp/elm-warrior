# Test Warrior

I notice there's no tests yet for elm-warrior so I've started to write some! You can see all the [tests in progress](https://github.com/sparksp/elm-warrior/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+base%3Atest+) on my fork before they get merged into this branch. I'll leave this branch in draft until they're all done or you decide there's enough to make it worth merging some.
